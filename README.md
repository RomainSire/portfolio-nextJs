# My Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio. As a freelance frontend developer, I use this portfolio as a digital business card to showcase my skills, work, and personality. You can view the live site at [romainsire.com](https://romainsire.com).

## About

The portfolio includes an about page, a work page, and a contact form. I'm also planning to add a blog in the future.

## Technology Stack

This project is built with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Mailgun for the contact form
- Sass modules for styling
- pnpm for package manager

## Project Structure

This project follows the standard structure for a Next.js application. The `src` directory contains all the code, `src/app` is basically the router, and the `public` directory contains static assets.

## Development

This project uses Next.js's built-in development server. You can start the server with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
